## ðŸ”’ Best Practices

### Rate Limiting
- Use delays between requests
- Don't collect from too many posts rapidly
- Respect Instagram's terms of service

### Account Safety
- Use a dedicated account for collection
- Don't run 24/7 automated collection
- Monitor for any account restrictions

### Data Privacy
- Only collect public comments
- Respect user privacy
- Follow GDPR/privacy regulations

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ChromeDriver not found:**
```bash
# Install ChromeDriver
brew install chromedriver  # macOS
sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver  # Ubuntu
```

**Instagram login required:**
- The script will pause for manual login
- Log in through the browser window
- Press Enter when ready

**No comments found:**
- Make sure the post has comments
- Try scrolling manually first
- Check if comments are restricted

**Rate limiting:**
- Increase delays between requests
- Use headless mode less frequently
- Switch to different IP if needed

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with verbose output
python instagram_collector.py URL --debug
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Tips
